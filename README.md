## **Project Overview** - edited

This project demonstrates how to host a Dynamic Web App on AWS, utilizing various AWS services for a scalable, secure, and highly available architecture. The key components include , creation of a Docker Hub account, 3-Tier AWs Network VPC, Nat Gateway 53, Security Groups, RDS Instances, Route 53, Bastion Host, SQL Scripting, IAM User Management and many more. The setup ensures high availability across multiple availability zones, security through security groups and SSL certificates, and scalability with auto-scaling groups.

## **Architecture**

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Created a 3 Tier VIPC with Public Subnets and Private App Subnets and Private Data Subnets in 2 availability zones to segregate different components and enhance security.
2. **Public Subnets:** Used for infrastructure components like the NAT Gateway and Application Load Balancer.
3. **Internet Gateway:** Enables communication between instances in the VPC and the internet.
4. **Private Subnets:** Used to host the web server, designed to serve web pages and applications over the internet securely.
5. **EC2 Instances:** Utilised to host the WordPress website, accessible via an EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint.
6. **Bastion Host:** Used to migrated data into the RDS database whiilst providing perimeter access and control security
7. **ECR Fargate:** Helps to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters.
9. **Application Load Balancer:** Distributes web traffic across an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances in two availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance.
10. **Availability Zones:** Ensures high availability and fault tolerance by deploying resources across multiple zones.
11. **Resources:** NAT Gateway, Bastion Host, and Application Load Balancer are deployed in Public Subnets.
12. **Auto Scaling Group:** Dynamically manages EC2 instances to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and elasticity.
13. **Route 53:** Used for domain name registration and DNS record management.
15. **SSL:** Secures the website with an SSL certificate.
16. **Security Groups:** Acts as a network firewall to control traffic.
17. **Instances:** Configured to access the internet via the NAT Gateway, even in private subnets.
18. **GitHub:** Used for version control and collaboration, storing web files.
19. **Certificate Manager:** Manages SSL/TLS certificates to secure application communications.
20. **SNS:** Simple Notification Service is configured to alert about activities within the Auto Scaling Group.
21. **EFS:** Used for a shared file system.
22. **RDS:** Used for database management.

## **Deployment Steps**

### VPC Setup 
1. Create a VPC with public and private subnets across two availability zones. **- edited**
2. Enable DNS Host names within the VPC. **- edited**
3. Set up Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC. **- edited**
4. Create the Public and Private Subnets for the availability zones enabling auto assign IP setting for the public subnets. **- edited**
5. Create a Route Table and add a route to direct network traffic to the Intenet Gateway and associate the two subnets with the route table. **- edited**
7. Create a NAT Gateway in the public subnet for internet access from private subnets.


### Security and Gateway Configuration
1. Configure security groups to allow necessary inbound and outbound traffic.

## **What problems did I solve by completing this project?**

1. **Scalability:** I was able to effectively Handle varying levels of web traffic efficiently through using AWS services like Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to automatically adjust the number of running instances based on traffic demand.
 
2. **Performance Optimisation:** I solved the problem of slow loading times and handling varying levels of web traffic effciently using AWS services like Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to automatically adjust the number of running instances based on traffic demand.

3. **Database Management:** Using AWS to host WordPress enabled me to effectively manage and optimise the database that supports WordPress through using Amazon RDS for managed MySQL a databases, enabling read replicas for load distribution.

4. **High Availability:** I Minimised downtime and ensuring continuous availability by deploying applications across 2 Availability Zones AZ1 & AZ2, using Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic, and setting up failover configurations.

5. **Cost Management:** I solved the problem of having high costs by supporting the deployment of a cost effective solution managing and optimising the costs associated with AWS resources. This was achieved through monitoring usage with AWS Cost Explorer, using AWS Budgets to set alerts, and leveraging Reserved Instances and Savings Plans for cost savings.

## **What issues did I face while working on the project and how did I resolve that issue?**
  
- **WordPress credentials issues:** I had faced the issue of my WordPress credentials automatically registering through an auto-fill feature generating a strong passsword which I did not record. I solved this issue by firstly deleting the existing EFS RDS and EC2 Instance and creating new EFS RDS and EC2 Instances. Once created, I then SSH'ed into the instance via Amazon Linux where I was to re-nstall the WordPress script which consisted of setting up the WordPress application on an EC2 instance, including Apache, PHP, MySQL, and mounting the Amazon EFS.

- **Increasing Costs:** The challenge of increasing cost also became a concern which I was able to resolve thorugh by firstly enabalbing MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) to enhance the security access of my root user account and enable best practice. Through this, I reduced the risk of fraudulent access to my account and using it resulting in high usage cost. Furthermore, I used AWS budgets and Cost Explorer to effectively manage costs by settting alerting and identifying which service was a high usage cost through visibility of the cost usage graph.  

 ## **What overall lessons did I learn?**
 
- **AWS Linux and Bash:** This project gave me the ability to increase my skills in AWS Linux and bash as I was required to use the EC2 Instance to install the WordPress script

- **Networking:** I further my knowledge on Networking through inplementation of tools such as the Internet Gateway. This enabled the resources within the VPC Public Subnet to connect to the internet, and resources within the VPC Private Subnet to connect to the internet via the NAT Gateway. The use of the NAT Gateway enables resources like the EC2 Instances on the Private App Subnet to access the internet and download package updates using 'Sudo Yum update' through SSH'ing into the EC2 instance. So there is a requirement for the EC2 Instance to have access to the internet without external users on the internet gaining access to the EC2 Instance.

- **IAM Management and Best Practice:** As part ot IAM Management best practice, I identified that it is not recommended to user a root account for cloud environment creation. Going forward, I increased the acess robustness of my root using account by regularly changing  passwords, using MFA (Mult Factor Authentication), removing access keys to the root account and reducing overall root user account user for sercurity perposes.

-  **IAM User Creation and Best Practice:** Through doing this project, I also identified that going forward, best practice would be to create a new IAM user for myself and only grant required access also setting up a MFA for the new user making this the primary use account going forward. This is not only best practice, but permits the use of defining a boundary of services that I only want to use. For example, am IAM user cannot be charged for a NAT Gateway, if they don't have permissions to
